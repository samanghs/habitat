Description: The `habitat` package offers tools for analyzing and comparing changes in habitat 
distributions using raster datasets. It is compatible with various datasets and supports 
threshold-based binary conversion to identify suitable habitats. This simplified package is 
particularly beneficial for students, users without expertise in programming, junior ecologists, 
environmental researchers, and conservation planners. It provides comprehensive spatial 
statistics and visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.
