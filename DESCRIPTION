Description: The `habitat` package provides tools to analyze and compare changes between two raster datasets 
    representing current and projected habitat distributions. It ensures compatibility of input data (e.g., extent, 
    CRS, and resolution) and allows users to perform threshold-based binary conversion. The package computes 
    habitat gain, loss, stable areas, and overall changes. This functionality is designed for ecological
    researchers, conservation planners, and others working in habitat modeling and landscape analysis.
