\title{Analyze Habitat Changes}
\usage{
hb_range(x, y, th)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A SpatRaster object representing the current habitat (binary). This raster should contain binary values indicating habitat presence and absence.}

\item{y}{A SpatRaster object representing the future habitat (binary). This raster should also contain binary values indicating habitat presence and absence.}

\item{th}{A numeric threshold value between 0 and 1, used to convert continuous data into a binary format before analysis.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Compt.By.Models}: A data frame with detailed metrics, including loss, gain, stable areas, and percentage changes.
\item \code{Diff.By.Pixel}: A SpatRaster showing pixel-wise differences between the current and future habitat maps.
}
}
\description{
Computes metrics such as gain, loss, stable areas, and total changes between two binary raster maps. Provides a detailed analysis of habitat changes over time.
}
\details{
Designed to compare two binary raster maps representing habitat data at different time points. Calculates various metrics to summarize the changes between the two maps, which can be used to assess the impact of environmental changes or conservation efforts.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create sample binary raster datasets or load it: for instance "r1" and "r2"
# Analyze habitat changes
result <- hb_range(r1, r2, th = 0.5)

# Display the computed metrics
print(result$Compt.By.Models)

# Plot the habitat changes
hb_plot(result$Compt.By.Models)
}
