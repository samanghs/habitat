\title{Calculate Habitat Changes Between Two Rasters}
\usage{
hb_changes(raster1, raster2)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster1}{A SpatRaster or RasterLayer object representing the first habitat map.}

\item{raster2}{A SpatRaster or RasterLayer object representing the second habitat map.}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster object representing the habitat changes.
}
\description{
Compares two binary raster files and generates a new raster highlighting areas of gain, loss, stability, and absence. This function is specifically designed for comparing habitat changes between two time points or scenarios.
}
\details{
hb_changes function ensures both input rasters are in the same CRS and extent, computes the differences, and generates a new raster with categories for gain (green), loss (red), stability (yellow), and absence (gray). It is useful for ecological and environmental studies to visualize how habitats have changed over time or under different conditions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create two sample rasters or load it: "r1" and "r2"

# Convert to binary
raster1_binary <- hb_binary(r1, th = 0.5)
raster2_binary <- hb_binary(r2, th = 0.5)

# Calculate changes
changes_raster <- hb_changes(raster1_binary, raster2_binary)

# Plot changes
hb_plot_changes(changes_raster)
}
