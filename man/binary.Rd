\title{Convert Raster to Binary Map}
\usage{
binary(x, th)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A RasterLayer or SpatRaster object. This represents the continuous raster dataset to be converted.}

\item{th}{A numeric threshold value between 0 and 1. This threshold determines the cutoff point for converting values to \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A binary RasterLayer or SpatRaster where values greater than the specified threshold are \code{TRUE}, and values less than or equal to the threshold are \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
This function converts a continuous raster dataset into a binary map based on a specified threshold. Values in the raster that are greater than the threshold are converted to \code{TRUE}, while values less than or equal to the threshold are converted to \code{FALSE}.
}
\details{
The function is designed to take a continuous raster dataset and convert it into a binary map. This is useful for applications where a binary classification of the data is needed, such as presence/absence mapping or suitability analysis.
}
\examples{
# Example usage with a SpatRaster object
library(terra)

# Create a sample raster dataset with random values
r <- rast(nrows=10, ncols=10, vals=runif(100))

# Convert the raster to a binary map using a threshold of 0.5
binary_map <- binary(r, th=0.5)

# Plot the resulting binary map
plot(binary_map, main="Binary Map (Threshold = 0.5)")
}
