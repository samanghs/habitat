\title{Summary Statistics for Raster Data}
\usage{
sstat(raster)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster}{A SpatRaster object. This represents the raster dataset for which summary statistics will be generated.}
}
\value{
A list containing summary statistics of the raster values. The list includes the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of the raster values.
}
\description{
This function provides summary statistics for a given SpatRaster object. It calculates key statistical measures to summarize the distribution of values within the raster dataset.
}
\details{
The function is designed to take a raster dataset and compute summary statistics that provide insights into the data's distribution and variability. These statistics are useful for understanding the overall characteristics of the raster data.
}
\examples{
# Example usage with a SpatRaster object


# Create a sample raster dataset with random values
raster <- rast(nrows=10, ncols=10, vals=runif(100))

# Generate the summary statistics for the raster
raster_summary <- sstat(raster)

# Display the summary statistics
print(raster_summary)
}
