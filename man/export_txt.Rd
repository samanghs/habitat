\examples{
# Example usage

# Create a sample result list with habitat change metrics
result <- list(Compt.By.Models = data.frame(Model = c("Model1", "Model2"),
Metric1 = c(0.1, 0.2), Metric2 = c(0.3, 0.4)))

# Export the habitat change metrics to a TXT file
export_txt(result, "habitat_results.txt")
